# Telemetry Activy Generator (TAG)

`tag` is a CLI app to generate telemetry activity such as:

* Forking a process
* Exec'ing a process
* File Creation
* File Modification
* File Deletion
* Network Connection

After a succesful run, `tag` will create a file containing information
about the generated activity.
